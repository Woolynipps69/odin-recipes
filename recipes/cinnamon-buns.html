    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <p><h4>Dough</h4></p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of butter</li>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><h4>Filling</h4></p>
        <p><ul>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><h4>Directions</h4></p>
    <p><h5>Make the Dough</h5></p>
    <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the warm milk, sugar, and melted butter.</p>
    <p>Sprinkle the yeast evenly over the milk mixture, stir, and let sit in a warm place for about 10 minutes until the yeast has bloomed.</p>
    <p>Add 4 cups of flour to the milk mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until just combined. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, until nearly doubled in size.</p>
    <p>Generously butter 2 9-inch round baking pans or standard cake pan and set aside.</p>
    <p><h5>Make the Filling</h5></p>
    <p>In a medium bowl, combine the brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon. Mix well, then set aside.</p>
    <p><h5>Finish Dough</h5></p>
    <p>Uncover the dough and add the remaining cup of flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir well, then turn out onto a clean surface. Leave a bit of flour nearby to use as needed, but try not to incorporate too much.</p>
    <p>Knead the dough for at least 10 minutes, adding more flour as necessary, until the dough just loses its stickiness and does not stick to the surface or your hands. The dough should be very smooth and spring back when poked.</p>
    <p>Roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about ½-inch (1 cm) thick. Fix the corners with a bench scraper or a spatula to make sure they are sharp and even.</p>
    <p><h5>Bring it all together</h5></p>
    <p>Sprad the filling evenly over the dough</p>
    <p>Starting from one short end, roll up the dough into a log and pinch the seam closed. Place seam-side down.</p>
    <p>cut the log into evenly pieces, about 1½ inches (8cm) thick. Place the cinnamon rolls in the prepared pans, 1 in the center and about 5 around the sides. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place for 35-45 minutes, until expanded by about half of their original volume. If you’re saving the cinnamon rolls for later, cover with plastic wrap and freeze for up 3 months.</p>
    <p><h5>Baking</h5></p>
    <p>Bake the cinnamon rolls for 25-30 minutes, in a 350F pre-heated oven until golden brown.</p>
